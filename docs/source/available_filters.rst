In its current form, MADYS comprises four classes which serve different purposes:

* ``SampleObject``: it allows one to create a catalog of objects will full astrometric, kinematic and photometric information. See HERE;
* ``ModelHandler``: handles data and metadata of local isochrone files, allowing one to inspect the locally available models and to download new ones. See HERE;
* ``IsochroneGrid``: builds and handles the final isochronal grid used for parameter determination. See HERE;
* ``FitParams``: stores the result of an isochronal analysis performed upon a SampleObject instance. See HERE.
